<h3>GUIDELINES ISSUED BY GOVERNMENT OF INDIA TO BE FOLLOWED BEFORE ISSUING SC, ST COMMUNITY CERTIFICATES</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>GENERAL: (APPLICABLE IN ALL CASES):</strong></li>
    <p>Where a person claims to belong to a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe by birth it should be verified: --
        <ul>
            <li>(i) that the person and his/her parents actually belong to the community claimed;</li>
            <li>(ii) that this community is included in the Presidential Orders specifying the Scheduled<br />
                 Castes and Scheduled Tribes in relation to the concerned State.</li>
            <li>(iii) that the person belongs to that State and to the area within that State in respect<br />
                of which the community has been scheduled;</li>
            <li>(iv) if the person claims to be a Scheduled Castes, he/she should profess either the Hindu<br />
                or the Sikh, Buddhist religion;</li>
            <li>(v) if the person claims to be a Scheduled Tribe, he/she may profess any religion.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <li><strong>CASES OF MIGRATION:</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li>(i) Where a person migrates from the portion of the State in respect of which his/her community is<br /> 
            scheduled to another part of the same State in respect of which his/her community is not scheduled,<br />
            he/she will continue to be deemed to be a member of the Scheduled Caste or the Scheduled Tribe, as the<br />
            case may be, in relation to that State;</li>
        <li>(ii) Where a person migrates from one State to another, he/she can claim to belong to a Scheduled Caste<br />
            or a Scheduled Tribe only in relation to the State to which he/she originally belonged and not in respect<br />
            of the State to which he/she has migrated.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>CLAIMS THROUGH MARRIAGE:</strong></li>
    <p>The guiding principle is that no person who was not a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe by birth will be deemed<br />
        to be a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe merely because he or she had married a person belonging to a <br />
        Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe.</p>
    <p>Similarly a person who is a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe would continue to be a member of that<br />
        Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe as the case may be, even after his or her marriage with a person who does not belong<br />
        to a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe.</p>
    <li><strong>CASES OF CONVERSION AND RE-CONVERSION</strong></li>
    <p><ul>
        <li>(i) Where a Scheduled Caste person gets converted to a religion other than Hinduism or Sikhism and then reconverts <br />
            himself back to Hinduism or Sikhism, he/she will be deemed to have reverted to his/her original Scheduled Caste, <br />
            if he/she is accepted by the members of that particular caste as one among them.</li>
        <li>(ii) In the case of a descendent of a Scheduled Caste convert, the mere fact of conversion to Hinduism or Sikhism <br />
            will not be sufficient to entitle him to be regarded as a member of the Scheduled Caste to which his/her forefathers <br />
            belonged. It will have to be established that such a convert has been accepted by members of the caste claimed as one <br />
            among themselves and has thus become a member of that caste.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <li><strong>CASES OF ADOPTION:</strong> </li>
    <p>Great care has to be exercised in dealing with cases where a person claims to be a Scheduled Caste on the ground that<br />
         he/she has been adopted by a Scheduled Caste person. The validity of the adoption has to be clearly established before<br />
         any caste certificate can be given. It is for the party to prove his/her claim by cogent and reliable evidence. And adoption<br />
         must be a valid one under the requirements given in section 6 to 11 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956.</p>
    <li><strong>CASTE STATUS OF OFFSPRING OF INTER-CASTE MARRIED PERSONS:</strong></li>
    <p>To determine the caste status of the offspring of the couple where one the spouses is a member of Schedule Caste / Schedule Tribe<br />
        the crucial test to determine the caste status of the offspring is that he/she shall be brought up on the Schedule Caste or <br />
        Schedule Tribe community and shall be treated as a member of the such community and shall be accepted by the community.</p>
    <li><strong>CASTE STATUS OF OFFSPRING OF DIVORCED/SEPARATED/SINGLE WOMEN:</strong></li>
    <p>To determine the caste status of the offspring of the Divorced / Separated / Single Women it is established that the child<br />
        has been brought up in the surroundings of a notified community to which the mother belongs to and has suffered the <br />
        deprivations, indignities, humilities and handicaps like any other member of that community and he or she was always <br />
        treated as a member of the mother's community not only by that community but by people outside the community as well, <br />
        then such a child of separated/divorced/single women has to be treated as a member of the Scheduled Caste community<br />
        and would be entitled to receive benefits as such.</p>
</ol>
<h3>CASE STUDIES:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>V.V.GIRI Vs D.S.Dora case (1959): This Judgement by Supreme Court concluded the crucial test to determine the caste status<br />
        of the child born to a couple where one of the spouses is a member of Schedule Caste. The caste status of such child shall be <br />
        determined on the basis that the surroundings he has been brought up and basing on the acceptance by the Schedule Caste <br />
        community as a member of their community.</li>
    <li>Mrs.Valsamma Paul Vs Cochin University (1996): The Supreme Court affirmed the position that reservation benefits under <br />
        Articles 15(4) and 16(4) are intended solely for individuals who belong to socially and educationally backward classes by <br />
        birth or have inherently suffered the associated disadvantages. The court held that marriage into a Backward Class does not<br />
         automatically confer eligibility for reservation benefits meant for that class. Valsamma Paul's appointment was thus <br />
         invalidated as she remained a member of the Forward Class despite her marital alliance with a Backward Class individual.</li>
    <li>A.Prathyusha Vs Registrar, NTR University of Health (1999):The Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Certificate is not a <br />
        bounty to be distributed. To sustain the claim, one must show that he/she suffered disabilities - socially, economically <br />
        and educationally cumulatively. The concerned authority, before whom such claim is made, is duty bound to satisfy itself<br />
         that the applicant suffered disabilities socially, economically and educationally before such certificate is issued. <br />
         Any concerned authority issuing such certificates in a routine manner would be committing the dereliction of Constitutional duty. </li>
    <li>Anjan Kumar Vs Union of India (2006):  The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal filed by Shri Anjan Kumar, quashing his ST <br />
        certificate issued in 1992. The court held that Kumar, being the offspring of a tribal woman married to a non-tribal man <br />
        (Kayastha), could not claim ST status. The judgment emphasized that mere marital affiliation does not confer tribal status <br />
        unless the individual is raised in a tribal environment and subjected to the disabilities that the reservation system aims <br />
        to address. Additionally, the court highlighted the fraudulent implications of obtaining ST certificates through misrepresentation,<br />
        stressing the need to protect genuine benefits intended for truly disadvantaged communities.</li>
    <li>Rameshbhai Dabhai Naika Vs State of Gujarat (2012): This Judgement by the Supreme Court concluded that practice of the <br />
        practice of issuance of caste certificate based on the caste of father is not without exceptions. In certain cases, where it<br />
         is established that the children have grown up in a notified community or tribe and have suffered all the disadvantages and <br />
         deprivations belonging to such community, the office order could not come in the way of issuance of caste certificate certifying <br />
         that the applicants belongs to caste of their mother.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">ANDHRA PRADESH STATE - BACKWARD CLASSES (BC) CERTIFICATES</h2>
    <ul><li>The Government of Andhra Pradesh appointed “Anantha Raman Commission” in the year 1968 to prepare a list of Backward Classes <br />
           in the State as socially and educationally Backward Classes.</li>
        <li>The Commission after studying the different types of communities submitted a report with a list consisting of 93 classes to <br />
            be included in the Backward Classes.</li>
        <li>The commission sub-divided the communities into 4 categories (A,B,C,D) basing on their backwardness.</li>
        <li>The Government accepted the criteria adopted by the Commission and issued G.O.Ms. No.1793 dated 23.09.1970 declaring that the <br />
            93 castes and communities specified by the Commission to be socially and educationally backward for making 25% reservation for them.</li>

<h3>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON OTHER BACKWARD CLASSES (OBC):</h3>
<p><span style="color: #0a2df0;font-weight:bold;">Question-1.</span>If the land/property (more than threshold limit) is in the name of parents and there are more than one child and the property<br />
    has not been distributed, then in that situation, can one of the children apply for EWS certificate?</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(9, 14, 9);font-weight: bold;">Answer:</span>No. Para 4.2 and 4.3 of said O.M. dated 31.01.2019 provides that the property held by a "Family" in different locations or different<br />
places/cities would be clubbed while applying the land or property holding test to determine EWS status and the term "Family" for this purpose <br />
will include the person who seeks benefit of reservation, his/her parents and siblings below the age of 18 years as also his/her spouse and children <br />
below the age of 18 years. Property beyond threshold limit tantamount to disqualification for applying to Income and Asset Certificate in respect of<br />
 any of the children.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0a2df0;font-weight:bold;">Question-2.</span> In case agricultural land/residential flat/plot of parents is located in more than one State/District or within the same <br />
State/District, all such land/properties will be clubbed or not?</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(9, 14, 9);font-weight: bold;">Answer:</span> Yes. Para 4.2 of said O.M. dated 31.01.2019 provides that, the property held by a "Family" in different locations or <br />
different places/cities would be clubbed while applying the land or property holding test to determine EWS status. Person can apply for Income <br />
and Asset Certificate in the district of his permanent address</p>
<p><span style="color: #0a2df0;font-weight: bold;">Question-3.</span>Does the residential flat/plot as classified under Para 4.1 of DoPT OM, dated 31.1.2019, Includes both commercial and residential property?</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(9, 14, 9);font-weight: bold;">Answer:</span>Para 4.1 of the OM, dated 31.1.2019, speaks of residential property. However, exclusion of commercial <br />
    property will result in injustice. Hence, the definition of residential flat/plot in the OM also includes the commercial property.</p>
